This file converts files from the provided directory to a txt file so ProPresenter 7 will accept them and import them correctly. First, it changes all files to txt files and then removes all of the opensong tags, and replaces the correct ones with propresenter appropriate one.

Usage: 
``` python3 ConvertOpensongToPropresenter.py ```
